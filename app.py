The dataset consists of a collection of labeled intents and patterns related to different electronic gadgets. Each intent has predefined patterns (user queries) and corresponding responses.

Here are some key intents and their examples:

Greeting:

Patterns: ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "How are you"]
Responses: ["Hello! How can I assist you with your gadget queries today?", "Hi there! What gadget information do you need?", "Hey! How can I help you today?"]

Goodbye:

Patterns: ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye", "Take care"]
Responses: ["Goodbye! Take care and enjoy your gadgets!", "See you later! Keep exploring tech!", "Goodbye! Feel free to ask me more gadget-related questions anytime!"]

Thanks:

Patterns: ["Thank you", "Thanks", "Thanks a lot", "I appreciate it"]
Responses: ["You're welcome! Stay tech-savvy!", "No problem! Glad I could help!", "You're welcome! Let me know if you have more questions!"]

About:

Patterns: ["What can you do", "Who are you", "What are you", "What is your purpose"]
Responses: ["I am a gadget information chatbot here to provide details about various electronic devices.", "My purpose is to assist you with information about gadgets and their features."]

Gadget Information:

For each gadget, such as iPhone 14, Dell XPS, LG OLED TV, and PlayStation 5, the chatbot identifies specific queries and provides detailed information on:
